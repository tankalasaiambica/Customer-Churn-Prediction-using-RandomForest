# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-RandomForest
The primary objective of the project is to analyze the past data and predict whether the customer will churn or not in the next 6 months.
Initial I have done some Exploratory data analysis on the dataset given dataset it is  a imbalance dataset. it consists of columns like (
ID,Age,Gender,Income,Balance,Vintage,Transaction_Status,Product_Holdings,Credit_Card,Credit_Category,Is_Churn) and Age,Income,Vintage,Credit_Category,Credit_Card feature are effecting the target column initial I train the model with the RandomForestClassifier and use the f1_score matrix for accuracy without dealing with the imbalance data.so we get the less accuracy  with is baseline that is 0.50.. and to solve this problem we we are resampling the given data using Over-sampling using SMOTE and cleaning using ENN.Combine over- and under-sampling using SMOTE and Edited Nearest Neighbours.And also hyper tuning parameters in RandomForestClassifier and using cv as StratifiedKFold and matrix as f1_score(macro)[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html] and fit the resample data to the model and we get this time high f1_score of 76% which is not a bad score
